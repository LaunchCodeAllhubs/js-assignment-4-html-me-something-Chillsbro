              <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My love for coding started when I moved to Kansas City from California.</br>
                I met a friend here, let's call him C-3P0. We met through a mutual friend.</br>
                We went disc golfing and C-3P0 brought up that he was working on a game.</br>
                I was intrigued that I could add sound effects with my music background, </br>
                and proceeded to show him a song of mine. He asked, "Who is this?" I said,</br> 
                "It's me!".
                From there we collaborated for a bit with game design </br>
                testing, and implementing sounds. Seeing how he would create physics, </br>                                   
                movement, designs, and so much more through coding connected the wires </br>
                in my brain to finally see the connection between the logic and artistic side. </br>
                The fire was ignited, and ever since then I have set my goals on becoming </br>
                a professional developer and changing career paths to something I truly</br> enjoy.

                I started drumming at 12 years old, when my dad brought home an old electronic drum set.
                I immediately sat down and started playing a simple beat. I had beatboxed
                a bit for fun,so I think that helped me initially, funny enough. My dad is a concert pianist,
                and had a band back in the 80's so we would frequently jam together and he would 
                help me with techniques, and dynamics. I taught myself from there on out, 
                played with a couple bands, and eventually started making music on my own.
                It's been a blast, learning melody along with rythym,
                and envisioning journeys to share through the medium of sound. For genres, as far as creating,
                my favorites would be: Drum n' Bass, Chillstep, Electro, House, & Trance.

                Disc golf is a newer hobby, but a great one nonetheless. 
                I've always enjoyed the outdoors, and competetion, which means Disc golf ticks the right boxes.
                It has beautiful courses, and is fun and free to play. (Minus the costs of discs and a backpack, of course.) 
                I'm the type of person to sit and work for 10 hours straight without realizing, so this sport is a good break from that. 
                I've now replaced the gym with playing disc golf, and find that it reinvigorates my brain to work better each day. (like working out.) 
                It's healthy competetion with friends, along with much needed sunshine and a low intensity workout
